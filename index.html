  <p class="about-content">Hi, I’m Lokesh Babu Katta, an IoT graduate from the Indian town of 
    Machilipatnam with a strong
     interest in building practical and user-centric technology solutions. My journey into
      technology began when I was first introduced to computers during my school years, which
       sparked my curiosity about how systems work and interact with the real world.</p>
<br>
    <p class="about-content">I pursued a B.Tech in Internet of Things, where I gained hands-on experience working with sensors,
 microcontrollers, embedded systems and web development. Through my academic projects, I developed a solid 
 understanding of how hardware and software integrate to solve real-world problems.</p>
 <br>
<p class="about-content">Alongside my IoT studies, I pursued a minor in Computer Science, where I gradually explored web development, starting with HTML and CSS, and gained foundational knowledge in DBMS and SQL. I enjoy building clean and responsive user interfaces.

I am currently strengthening my understanding of DSA fundamentals and focusing on improving my problem-solving skills step by step through consistent practice.</p>
<br>
<p class="about-content">I enjoy learning by building projects and believe in consistent improvement through practice. 
Given the opportunity, I aim to apply my technical skills, problem-solving mindset, and curiosity
 to design, develop, and maintain meaningful software and IoT-based solutions.</p>
